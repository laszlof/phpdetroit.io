        <p>PHPDetroit started as a <a href="https://meetup.com/phpdetroit">small meetup group</a> located in the Metro Detroit area. We've since grown to nearly 500 members, with experience ranging from first time developers, to seasoned veterans with decades of experience.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to bring together like-minded PHP developers in an effort to network with our peers, learn new skills, and teach others. We welcome you to join us in our journey.</p>
