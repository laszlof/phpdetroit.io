Larry Garfield has been building websites since he was a sophomore in high
school, which is longer ago than he'd like to admit.  Larry was an active
Drupal contributor and consultant for over a decade, and led the Drupal 8 Web
Services initiative that helped transform Drupal into a modern PHP platform.

Larry is Director of Developer Experience at Platform.sh, a leading continuous
deployment cloud hosting company.  He is also a member of the PHP-FIG Core
Committee.

Larry holds a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from DePaul University.  He
blogs at both [platform.sh](https://platform.sh) and [www.garfieldtech.com](https://www.garfieldtech.com).
