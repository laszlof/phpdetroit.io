Ryan is a member of the Symfony core team, lead of its documentation and tutorial writer for [KnpUniversity](https://knpUniversity.com). When it comes to code, heâ€™s all about developer experience: how can we get great tools into the hands of more people... and hopefully make it really fun along the way. He also lives right here in Michigan (born in Ypsilanti) where he hangs out with his much-more-talented wife Leanna and much-better-looking toddler son Beckett.
