Chris Hartjes has worked on web applications of all shapes and sizes since 1998, mostly in PHP. He is a self-published author and conference organizer trying to find ways to give back to the community that helped him build his career.

Monday to Thursday he works for Mozilla testing services that Firefox talks to. On Fridays he works on expanding his Grumpy Learning info-product empire. In the evening he gets yelled at by his wife for playing with his phone too much.

He works from his office in the snowy wilds of Canada.
