A crash course in the history, theory, and implementation of the internet of today. Learn about TCP/IP, headers, packets, HTTP both 1 and 2, and all the glorious technology that makes web developers tick. Finally take a dive into sockets and peek a bit into hardware, and understand why no matter how fat your vm is why you still run out of socket connections. All the things DARPA folks wish you knew before you wrote that first webapp.
