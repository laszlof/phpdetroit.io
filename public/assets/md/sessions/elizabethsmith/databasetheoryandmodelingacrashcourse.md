Wouldn't it be great if everyone had a DBA to design and manage data for you? Most places don't have this luxury, instead the burden falls on the developer.

Data modeling and theory is the process of taking your application and designing how to store and process your data in a way that won't melt down.

We'll also walk through "refactoring data" using normalization and optimization.
