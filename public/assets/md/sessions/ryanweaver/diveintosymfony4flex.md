Symfony 4 is out! And it's the best Symfony ever! Faster! Re-imagined developer experience! And easier to create the feature you need! In this workshop, we'll bootstrap a new Symfony app and learn about Symfony Flex: the secret behind the fact that Symfony automatically scales from a "microframework" to a "macroframework" as your app grows. We'll also leverage the new dependency injection features that will let us build the same high-quality features in a fraction of the time and code. Let's rock!
