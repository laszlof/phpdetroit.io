Need to store schema-less data or do you need a data store but do not know structured query language (SQL)? The MySQL Document Store allows developers with NoSQL skills to use the popular database as a NoSQL database. The new X DevAPI greatly broadens the usefulness of the MySQL database for those who do not want to write SQL queries. Languages supported include JavaScript, C++, Java, Node.JS, PHP, Python, and more. This presentation has lots of programming examples and a demo of the new MySQL Shell.
