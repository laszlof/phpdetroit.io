This conference used OpenCFP, an open source PHP web application for accepting talk proposals. As the lead developer on the project, I wanted to make sure I was releasing code into production that was good enough to share with others with minimal friction.

Being someone who is way deep into testing, I discovered that having tests wasn't enough to ensure the quality I was looking for.

In this talk I'll share my thoughts on some tools that I think complement a good test suite:
  * continuous integration tools
  * mutation testing
  * static code analysis
  * code style checkers
  * and also discuss the growth of the project and how we successfully integrate submissions from developers around the world.


If you're looking to apply some structure to your development workflow, these tools and concepts are a great place to start!
